## Objective
To reproduce "Deep Convolutional Dictionary Learning" algorithm for image denoising and improve the model architecture for denoising the images with other noise distributions.

## Approach
"Deep Convolutional Dictionary Learning" algorithm

Improvements: Adding a 3x3 median filter followed by a 3x3 Gaussian blurring filter in pre-processing stage.

## Results
Train dataset: WED

Test dataset: URBAN100
